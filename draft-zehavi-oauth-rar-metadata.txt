               OAuth 2.0 RAR Metadata and Error Signaling
                 draft-zehavi-oauth-rar-metadata-latest

Abstract

   OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), as defined in [RFC9396],
   enables fine-grained authorization requests, using structured JSON
   objects.

   While RAR [RFC9396] standardizes the exchange and handling of
   authorization details, it does not define a mechanism for clients to
   discover how to construct valid authorization details types.

   This document defines a machine-readable metadata format for
   authorization servers to provide authorization details type
   documentation and JSON Schema [JSON.Schema] definitions, as well as
   interoperable discovery via OAuth Resource Server Metadata [RFC9728].

   This document also defines a new WWW-Authenticate normative OAuth
   error code, insufficient_authorization_details, enabling resource
   servers to indicate inadequate authorization details as the cause of
   failure.

   It also defines an OPTIONAL response body which MAY be returned
   alongside the insufficient_authorization_details error, providing an
   informative yet actionable authorization details object, which can be
   used directly in a subsequent OAuth request.

1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) [RFC9396] allows OAuth
   clients to request structured, fine-grained authorization, beyond the
   coarse-grained access offered by simple scopes, which has enabled
   advanced authorization models across many domains, such as open
   banking & API marketplaces.

   However, RAR [RFC9396] does not specify how a client learns how to
   construct syntactically valid authorization details objects.  As a
   result, clients must rely on out-of-band documentation or static
   ecosystem profiles, limiting interoperability and preventing dynamic
   client behavior.

   This document addresses this gap by:

   *  Defining a new authorization server endpoint:
      authorization_details_types_metadata_endpoint, providing metadata
      for authorization details types, including human-readable
      documentation as well as embedded JSON Schema definitions
      [JSON.Schema].

   *  Adding accepted authorization details types to OAuth 2.0 Protected
      Resource Metadata [RFC9728] response, facilitating RAR metadata
      discovery.

   *  Defining a standardized error signaling mechanism using the WWW-
      Authenticate response header, allowing resource servers to specify
      insufficient_authorization_details as the cause of error.

   *  Defining an OPTIONAL response body, included with an
      insufficient_authorization_details error, providing an informative
      authorization details object, whose inclusion in a new OAuth
      request shall result, if approved, in an access token satisfying
      the endpoint's requirements.

   The OPTIONAL providing of actionable authorization details objects by
   resource servers enables:

   *  High interoperability and simplification by relieving clients from
      having to figure out how to construct valid authorization details
      objects, instead providing them with required
      authorization_details object, to be included in a subsequent OAuth
      request.

   *  Support for including ephemeral, interaction-specific details
      originating from the resource domain, in the authorization details
      object, such as for example a risk score, a risk profile or an
      internal interaction identifier.  Resource servers MAY use this to
      guide authorization servers as to the required authentication
      strength and consent flow.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol Overview

   There are two main proposed flows:

   *  Client *learns* to construct valid authorization details objects
      using authorization details types metadata.

   *  Client *obtains an actionable authorization details object* from
      resource server's error response.

      using metadata

4.  OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata [RFC9728]

   This document specifies that the metadata attribute:
   authorization_details_types_supported, defined by RAR [RFC9396],
   shall be included as an OPTIONAL response attributes in Protected
   Resource Metadata [RFC9728].

   Note: When resource servers accept access tokens _from several
   authorization servers_, interoperability is maintained as client can
   discover each authorization server' supported authorization details
   types.

   The following is a non-normative example response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json

   { "resource": "https://resource.example.com",
   "authorization_servers": ["https://as1.example.com",
   "https://as2.example.net"], "bearer_methods_supported": ["header",
   "body"], "scopes_supported": ["profile", "email", "phone"],
   "resource_documentation": "https://resource.example.com/
   resource_documentation.html",
   "authorization_details_types_supported": ["payment_initiation"] }

5.  Authorization Details Types Metadata Endpoint

   The following authorization server metadata [RFC8414] parameter is
   introduced to signal the server's support for Authorization Details
   Types Metadata:

   "authorization_details_types_metadata_endpoint":  OPTIONAL.  The URL
      of the Authorization Details Types Metadata endpoint.

5.1.  Authorization Details Types Metadata Endpoint Response

   The Authorization Details Types Metadata endpoint's response is a
   JSON document with the key authorization_details_types_metadata whose
   attributes are authorization details type identifiers.

   Each identifier is an object describing a single authorization
   details type.

   {
     "authorization_details_types_metadata": {
       "type": {
       "version": "...",
       "description": "...",
       "documentation_uri": "...",
       "schema": { },
       "schema_uri": "...",
       "examples": [ ]
       }
     }
   }

   Attributes definition:

   "version":  OPTIONAL.  String identifying the version of the
      authorization details type definition.  The value is informational
      and does not imply semantic version negotiation.

   "description":  OPTIONAL.  String containing a human-readable
      description of the authorization details type.  Clients MUST NOT
      rely on this value for authorization or validation decisions.

   "documentation_uri":  OPTIONAL.  URI referencing external human-
      readable documentation describing the authorization details type.

   "schema":  The schema attribute is a JSON Schema document
      [JSON.Schema] describing a single authorization detail object.
      The schema MUST validate a single authorization detail object and
      MUST constrain the type attribute to the authorization detail type
      identifier.  This attribute is REQUIRED unless schema_uri is
      specified.  If this attribute is present, schema_uri MUST NOT be
      present.

   "schema_uri":  The schema_uri attribute is an absolute URI, as
      defined by RFC 3986 [RFC3986], referencing a JSON Schema document
      describing a single authorization details object.  The referenced
      schema MUST satisfy the same requirements as the schema attribute.
      This attribute is REQUIRED unless schema is specified.  If this
      attribute is present, schema MUST NOT be present.

   "examples":  OPTIONAL.  An array of example authorization details
      objects.  Examples are non-normative.

   See Examples Appendix A.1 for non-normative response example.

6.  Resource Server Error Signaling of Inadequate authorization_details

   This document defines a new normative OAuth error code,
   insufficient_authorization_details, which resource servers SHALL
   return using the WWW-Authenticate header, to signal access is denied
   due to missing or insufficient authorization details.

   Example HTTP response:

   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_authorization_details",
       resource_metadata="https://resource.example.com/
       .well-known/oauth-protected-resource/payments"

6.1.  OPTIONAL authorization_details in response body

   Resource server MAY provide alongside the
   insufficient_authorization_details error, an HTTP response body of
   content type application/json, containing the required authorization
   details to satisfy the currently failing request.

   Note:

   *  Authorization details objects provided by a resource server in an
      error response are intended for its trusted authorization servers,
      as advertised by the Resource Server’s metadata endpoint.

   *  Resource servers SHALL provide authorization_details objects only
      if *all* trusted authorization servers accept the *authorization
      details type* used.

   HTTP response body definition:

   "authorization_details":  OPTIONAL.  Array of authorization details
      objects, matching the format specified in RAR [RFC9396] for the
      authorization_details request parameter.

   Clients MAY use the provided authorization_details in a subsequent
   OAuth request to obtain an access token satisfying the resource's
   requirements.

   Example resource server response with OPTIONAL authorization_details:

   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_authorization_details",
       resource_metadata="https://resource.example.com/
       .well-known/oauth-protected-resource/payments"
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "authorization_details": [{
       "type": "payment_initiation",
       "instructedAmount": {
         "currency": "EUR",
         "amount": "100.00"
       },
       "creditorAccount": {
         "iban": "DE02120300000000202051"
       }
     }]
   }

7.  Processing Rules

7.1.  Client Processing Rules

   *  If encountering error insufficient_authorization_details, check if
      body.authorization_details exists and if provided MAY include in
      subsequent OAuth request.

   *  Otherwise consult metadata:

      -  Fetch resource metadata to discover accepted authorization
         servers and supported *authorization_details types*.

      -  Fetch authorization server metadata to discover
         authorization_details_types_supported.

      -  Fetch authorization server's
         authorization_details_types_metadata_endpoint to obtain
         metadata and schema

      -  Locate schema or retrieve schema_uri.

   *  Construct authorization details conforming to the schema and
      include in subsequent OAuth request.

7.2.  Resource Server Processing Rules

   *  Advertise in resource metadata
      authorization_details_types_supported, where relevant.

   *  Verify access tokens against required authorization details.

   *  If insufficient, return HTTP 403 with WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
      error="insufficient_authorization_details".

   *  OPTIONALLY provide also an HTTP body with an informative
      actionable authorization_details object.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Cacheability and Intermediaries

   HTTP 403 responses with response bodies may be cached or replayed in
   unexpected contexts.  Recommended mitigation is resource servers
   SHALL use Cache-Control: no-store response header.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Error Registry

     +====================================+=========================+
     | Error Code                         | Description             |
     +====================================+=========================+
     | insufficient_authorization_details | The request is missing  |
     |                                    | required authorization  |
     |                                    | details or the provided |
     |                                    | authorization details   |
     |                                    | are insufficient.       |
     +------------------------------------+-------------------------+

                                 Table 1

9.2.  OAuth Metadata Attribute Registration

   The metadata attribute authorization_details_types_metadata_endpoint
   is defined for OAuth authorization server metadata as a URL.

A.2.  Payment initiation with RAR error signaling

A.2.1.  Client initiates API request

   Client uses access token obtained at login to call payment initiation
   API

   POST /payments HTTP/1.1
   Host: resource.example.com
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer eyj... (access token from login)

   {
       "type": "payment_initiation",
       "locations": [
           "https://resource.example.com/payments"
       ],
       "instructedAmount": {
           "currency": "EUR",
           "amount": "123.50"
       },
       "creditorName": "Merchant A",
       "creditorAccount": {
           "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
           "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
       }
   }

A.2.2.  Resource server signals insufficient_authorization_details with
        actionable RAR object

   Resource server requires payment approval and responds with:

   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_authorization_details",
       resource_metadata="https://resource.example.com
       /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/payments"
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
       "authorization_details": [{
         "type": "payment_initiation",
         "locations": [
             "https://example.com/payments"
         ],
         "instructedAmount": {
             "currency": "EUR",
             "amount": "123.50"
         },
         "creditorName": "Merchant A",
         "creditorAccount": {
             "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
             "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
         },
         "interactionId": "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6",
         "riskProfile": "B-71"
   }]
   }

   Note: the resource server has added the ephemeral attributes
   interactionId and riskProfile.

A.2.3.  Client initiates OAuth flow using the provided
        authorization_details object

   After user approves the request, client obtains single-use access
   token representing the approved payment

A.2.4.  Client re-attempts API request

   POST /payments HTTP/1.1
   Host: resource.example.com
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer eyj... (payment approval access token)

   {
       "type": "payment_initiation",
       "locations": [
           "https://resource.example.com/payments"
       ],
       "instructedAmount": {
           "currency": "EUR",
           "amount": "123.50"
       },
       "creditorName": "Merchant A",
       "creditorAccount": {
           "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
           "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
       }
   }

A.2.5.  Resource server authorizes the request

   HTTP/1.1 201 Accepted
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
       "paymentId": "a81bc81b-dead-4e5d-abff-90865d1e13b1",
       "status": "accepted"
   }
