               OAuth 2.0 RAR Metadata and Error Signaling
                 draft-zehavi-oauth-rar-metadata-latest

Abstract

   OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), as defined in [RFC9396],
   enables clients to request fine-grained authorization using
   structured JSON objects.  While RAR [RFC9396] standardizes the
   exchange and handling of authorization details, it does not define a
   mechanism for clients to discover how to construct valid
   authorization details types.

   This document defines a machine-readable metadata structure for
   advertising authorization details type documentation and JSON Schema
   [JSON.Schema] definitions by authorization servers, with additional
   discovery support through OAuth Resource Server Metadata [RFC9728].

   This document also defines a new WWW-Authenticate normative OAuth
   error code, insufficient_authorization_details, enabling resource
   servers to indicate inadequate authorization details as the cause of
   failure.  It also defines an OPTIONAL response body which MAY be
   returned alongside the insufficient_authorization_details error,
   providing an actionable authorization details object, which may be
   used directly in a subsequent OAuth request.

1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) [RFC9396] allows OAuth
   clients to request structured, fine-grained authorization, beyond the
   coarse-grained access offered by simple scopes, which has enabled
   advanced authorization models across domains, such as open banking &
   API marketplaces.

   However, RAR [RFC9396] does not specify how a client learns how to
   construct syntactically valid authorization details objects.  As a
   result, clients must rely on out-of-band documentation or static
   ecosystem profiles, limiting interoperability and preventing dynamic
   client behavior.

   This document addresses this gap by defining:

   *  A new authorization server endpoint:
      authorization_details_types_metadata_endpoint, providing metadata
      for authorization details types, including human-readable
      documentation as well as embedded JSON Schema definitions
      [JSON.Schema].

   *  Adding _expected authorization details types_ to OAuth 2.0
      Protected Resource Metadata [RFC9728] response, enabling their
      discovery.

   *  A standardized error signaling mechanism using the WWW-
      Authenticate response header, allowing resource servers to specify
      insufficient_authorization_details as the cause of error, as well
      as an OPTIONAL response body providing an informative
      authorization details object, whose inclusion in a new OAuth
      request shall result, if approved, in an access token satisfying
      the endpoint's requirements.

   The OPTIONAL solution pattern whereby resource server returns an
   actionable authorization details object enables:

   *  High interoperability and simplification by relieving clients from
      having to figure out how to construct valid authorization details
      objects, instead providing them with required
      authorization_details object, to be included in a subsequent OAuth
      request.

   *  Support for including ephemeral, interaction-specific details in
      the authorization details object, such as for example a risk
      score, a risk profile or an internal interaction identifier.  This
      enables resource servers to guide the authorization server as to
      the required authentication strength and consent flow.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol Overview

   There are two main proposed flows:

   *  Client learns to construct valid authorization details objects
      using authorization details types metadata.

   *  Client obtains an actionable authorization details object from
      resource server's error response.

4.  OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata [RFC9728]

   This document specifies that the existing
   authorization_details_types_supported metadata attributed defined by
   RAR [RFC9396], shall be included as an OPTIONAL response attributes
   in Protected Resource Metadata [RFC9728].

5.  Authorization Details Type Metadata Endpoint

   The following authorization server metadata parameter [RFC8414] is
   introduced to signal the server's support for Authorization Details
   Type Metadata.

   "authorization_details_types_metadata_endpoint":  OPTIONAL.  The URL
      of the Authorization Details Type Metadata endpoint.

5.1.  Authorization Details Type Metadata Endpoint Response

   The Authorization Details Type Metadata endpoint's response is a JSON
   object whose keys are authorization details type identifiers.  Each
   value is an object describing a single authorization details type.

   {
   "authorization_details_types_metadata": {
       "type": {
       "version": "...",
       "description": "...",
       "documentation_uri": "...",
       "schema": { },
       "schema_uri": "...",
       "examples": [ ]
       }
   }
   }

   Attributes definition:

   "version":  OPTIONAL.  String identifying the version of the
      authorization details type definition.  The value is informational
      and does not imply semantic version negotiation.

   "description":  OPTIONAL.  String containing a human-readable
      description of the authorization details type.  Clients MUST NOT
      rely on this value for authorization or validation decisions.

   "documentation_uri":  OPTIONAL.  URI referencing external human-
      readable documentation describing the authorization details type.

   "schema":  The schema attribute is a JSON Schema document
      [JSON.Schema] describing a single authorization detail object.
      The schema MUST validate a single authorization detail object and
      MUST constrain the type attribute to the authorization detail type
      identifier.  This attribute is REQUIRED unless schema_uri is
      specified.  If this attribute is present, schema_uri MUST NOT be
      present.

   "schema_uri":  The schema_uri attribute is an absolute URI, as
      defined by RFC 3986 [RFC3986], referencing a JSON Schema document
      describing a single authorization details object.  The referenced
      schema MUST satisfy the same requirements as the schema attribute.
      This attribute is REQUIRED unless schema is specified.  If this
      attribute is present, schema MUST NOT be present.

   "examples":  OPTIONAL.  An array of example authorization details
      objects.  Examples are non-normative.

6.  Resource Server Error Signaling of Inadequate authorization_details

   This document defines a new normative OAuth error code,
   insufficient_authorization_details, for use when access is denied due
   to missing or insufficient authorization details.  The error code
   SHALL be conveyed using the WWW-Authenticate header.

   *  An OPTIONAL response body which resource servers MAY use, in
      addition to the WWW-Authenticate response header, to provide an
      actionable authorization details *object*, whose inclusion in a
      subsequent OAuth request, shall result in an access token
      satisfying the endpoint's requirements.

6.1.  OPTIONAL authorization_details in response body

   Authorization server MAY return alongside the
   insufficient_authorization_details error also an informative response
   body, of content type application/json, containing the required
   authorization details to satisfy the currently failing request.
   Definition:

   "authorization_details":  OPTIONAL.  JSON of authorization details
      object.

   Example:

   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
     error="insufficient_authorization_details"

   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "authorization_details": {
       "type": "payment_initiation",
       "instructedAmount": {
         "currency": "EUR",
         "amount": "100.00"
       },
       "creditorAccount": {
         "iban": "DE02120300000000202051"
       }
     }
   }

   Clients MAY use the provided authorization_details in a subsequent
   OAuth request.

   *  Fetch authorization_details_types_metadata from the authorization
      or resource server's metadata endpoints.

   *  Locate schema or retrieve schema_uri.

   *  Construct authorization details conforming to the schema.

   *  If resource server returns error
      insufficient_authorization_details, use provided
      authorization_details in subsequent OAuth request, then provide
      the obtained token to resource server.

7.2.  Authorization Server Processing Rules

   *  Advertise authorization_details_types_metadata in metadata.

   *  Validate each authorization detail against schema.

   *  Enforce additional semantic checks.

   *  Reject missing or invalid details with standard OAuth error
      semantics.

7.3.  Resource Server Processing Rules

   *  Advertise authorization_details_types_metadata.

   *  Verify tokens against required authorization details.

   *  If insufficient, return HTTP 403 with WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
      error="insufficient_authorization_details".

   *  Do not reveal additional sensitive information.

9.2.  OAuth Metadata Attribute Registration

   The metadata attribute authorization_details_types_metadata is
   defined for OAuth authorization and resource server metadata, as a
   JSON object mapping authorization details types to documentation,
   schema, and examples.

A.2.  Payment initiation with RAR error signaling

A.2.1.  Client initiates API request

   Client uses access token obtained at login to call payment initiation
   API

   POST /payments HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer eyj... (access token from login)

   {
       "type": "payment_initiation",
       "locations": [
           "https://server.example.com/payments"
       ],
       "instructedAmount": {
           "currency": "EUR",
           "amount": "123.50"
       },
       "creditorName": "Merchant A",
       "creditorAccount": {
           "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
           "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
       }
   }

A.2.2.  Resource server signals insufficient_authorization_details

   Resource server requires payment approval and responds with:

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_authorization_details",
    resource_metadata="https://server.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/payments",
    authorization_details=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

   The base64 encoded authorization_details decodes to:

   [{
       "type": "payment_initiation",
       "locations": [
           "https://example.com/payments"
       ],
       "instructedAmount": {
           "currency": "EUR",
           "amount": "123.50"
       },
       "creditorName": "Merchant A",
       "creditorAccount": {
           "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
           "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
       },
       "interactionId": "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6",
       "riskProfile": "B-71"
   }]

   Note the resource server has added the ephemeral attributes:
   interactionId, riskProfile.

A.2.3.  Client initiates OAuth flow using the provided
        authorization_details object

   After user approves the request, client obtains single-use access
   token representing the approved payment

A.2.4.  Client re-attempts API request

   POST /payments HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer eyj... (payment approval access token)

   {
       "type": "payment_initiation",
       "locations": [
           "https://server.example.com/payments"
       ],
       "instructedAmount": {
           "currency": "EUR",
           "amount": "123.50"
       },
       "creditorName": "Merchant A",
       "creditorAccount": {
           "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
           "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
       }
   }

A.2.5.  Resource server authorizes the request

   HTTP/1.1 201 Accepted
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
       "paymentId": "a81bc81b-dead-4e5d-abff-90865d1e13b1",
       "status": "accepted"
   }
