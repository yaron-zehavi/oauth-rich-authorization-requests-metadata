               OAuth 2.0 RAR Metadata and Error Signaling
                 draft-zehavi-oauth-rar-metadata-latest

Abstract

   OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), as defined in [RFC9396],
   enables clients to request fine-grained authorization using
   structured JSON objects.  While RAR [RFC9396] standardizes the
   exchange and handling of authorization details, it does not define a
   mechanism for clients to discover how to construct valid
   authorization details types.

   This document defines a machine-readable metadata structure for
   advertising authorization details type documentation and JSON Schema
   [JSON.Schema] definitions via OAuth Authorization Server Metadata
   [RFC8414] and OAuth Resource Server Metadata [RFC9728].

   In addition, this document defines a new OAuth error code,
   insufficient_authorization_details, enabling resource servers to
   return actionable authorization details objects to clients.

1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) [RFC9396] allows OAuth
   clients to request structured, fine-grained authorization, beyond the
   coarse-grained access offered by simple scopes.  This has enabled
   advanced authorization models across domains, such as open banking &
   API marketplaces, and is well positioned for authorizing AI agents to
   perform state-changing actions.

   However, RAR [RFC9396] does not specify how a client discovers the
   structure of supported authorization_detail types and how to
   construct syntactically valid authorization details.

   As a result, clients must rely on out-of-band documentation or static
   ecosystem profiles, limiting interoperability and preventing dynamic
   client behavior.

   This document addresses this gap by defining:

   *  A metadata structure for authorization details types, containing
      both human-readable documentation as well as embedded JSON Schema
      [JSON.Schema] definitions.

   *  Discovery through Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414], as well
      as via OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata [RFC9728].

   *  A standardized error signaling mechanism, allowing resource
      servers to return an authorization details object, to be included
      in a new Auth request, in order to accomplish a specific request.

   It is up to implementers to decide if their clients MUST learn to
   construct valid authorization details objects, and if so whether
   authorization details types metadata should be provided by
   authorization servers, resource servers or both.

   This document also outlines a solution pattern relieving clients from
   having to learn how to construct valid authorization details objects,
   instead providing clients the required authorization_details objects
   in resource servers' error responses.  Clients then include the
   provided authorization details objects in subsequent OAuth requests.

   This latter option is especially useful, as it enables resource
   servers to include ephemeral, interaction-specific details in the
   authorization details object, which are part of the resource domain,
   such as a risk score, risk profile or an internal interaction
   identifier.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol Overview

   There are two main proposed flows, either of them or both may be
   offered in parallel:

   *  Client learns to construct valid authorization details objects
      from authorization details types metadata provided by
      authorization servers, resource servers or both.

   *  Client obtains authorization details object from resource server's
      error response, providing an actionable authorization details
      object, whose inclusion in subsequent OAuth requests is required
      to accomplish a specific request.

   Figure: Client obtains authorization details object from resource
   server's error response

   *  (A) The user starts the flow.

   *  (B) The client calls an API with an access token.

   *  (C) Resource server returns HTTP 403 forbidden because the access
      token does not contain required authorization details.  Resource
      server's response includes a WWW-Authenticate header with the
      authorization details object requiring approval.

   *  (D) The client uses the obtained authorization details object in a
      new OAuth + RAR [RFC9396] request.

   *  (E) Authorization server returns authorization code.

   *  (G-H) The client exchanges authorization code for access token.

   *  (I) The client makes API request with access token.

   *  (J) Resource server validates access token and returns successful
      response.

4.  Authorization Details Type Metadata

4.1.  Overview

   This document defines a new metadata attribute,
   authorization_details_types_metadata, which provides documentation
   and validation information for authorization details types used with
   Rich Authorization Requests [RFC9396].

   The new metadata property MAY be published by OAuth authorization
   servers using Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414] as well as by
   Resource Servers using Protected Resource Metadata [RFC9728].

   Clients MAY use this metadata to dynamically construct valid
   authorization_details objects.

   This document also proposes the existing
   authorization_details_types_supported metadata attributed defined by
   RAR [RFC9396], be included in Protected Resource Metadata [RFC9728].

4.2.  Metadata Location

   The authorization_details_types_metadata attribute may be included
   in:

   *  Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414], to describe authorization
      details types supported by the authorization server.  If present,
      its keys MUST be a subset of the values listed in
      authorization_details_types_supported as defined in [RFC9396].

   *  OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata [RFC9728], to describe
      authorization details types accepted by the protecred resource.

4.3.  Metadata Structure

   The authorization_details_types_metadata attribute is a JSON object
   whose keys are authorization details type identifiers.  Each value is
   an object describing a single authorization details type.

   {
   "authorization_details_types_metadata": {
       "type": {
       "version": "...",
       "description": "...",
       "documentation_uri": "...",
       "schema": { },
       "schema_uri": "...",
       "examples": [ ]
       }
   }
   }

   Attributes definition:

   "version":  OPTIONAL.  String identifying the version of the
      authorization details type definition.  The value is informational
      and does not imply semantic version negotiation.

   "description":  OPTIONAL.  String containing a human-readable
      description of the authorization details type.  Clients MUST NOT
      rely on this value for authorization or validation decisions.

   "documentation_uri":  OPTIONAL.  URI referencing external human-
      readable documentation describing the authorization details type.

   "schema":  The schema attribute is a JSON Schema document
      [JSON.Schema] describing a single authorization detail object.
      The schema MUST validate a single authorization detail object and
      MUST constrain the type attribute to the authorization detail type
      identifier.  This attribute is REQUIRED unless schema_uri is
      specified.  If this attribute is present, schema_uri MUST NOT be
      present.

   "schema_uri":  The schema_uri attribute is an absolute URI, as
      defined by RFC 3986 [RFC3986], referencing a JSON Schema document
      describing a single authorization details object.  The referenced
      schema MUST satisfy the same requirements as the schema attribute.
      This attribute is REQUIRED unless schema is specified.  If this
      attribute is present, schema MUST NOT be present.

   "examples":  OPTIONAL.  An array of example authorization details
      objects.  Examples are non-normative.

5.  Resource Server Error Signaling with
    insufficient_authorization_details

5.1.  Overview

   This document defines a new OAuth error code,
   insufficient_authorization_details, for use when access is denied due
   to missing or insufficient authorization details.

5.2.  Error Definition

   The error MUST be conveyed using the WWW-Authenticate header and MUST
   include an authorization_details parameter.

5.3.  authorization_details Error Parameter

   The parameter MUST contain a JSON object or array, representing the
   required authorization details, whose inclusion in a subsequent OAuth
   request is required to satisfy the resource server's requirements for
   this specific request.  The value MUST be base64url-encoded.

   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_authorization_details",
   authorization_details="{base64url-encoded JSON of required RAR}"

6.  Processing Rules

6.1.  Client Processing Rules

   *  Fetch authorization_details_types_metadata from the authorization
      or resource server's metadata endpoints.

   *  Locate schema or retrieve schema_uri.

   *  Construct authorization details conforming to the schema.

   *  If resource server returns error
      insufficient_authorization_details, use provided
      authorization_details in subsequent OAuth request, then provide
      the obtained token to resource server.

6.2.  Authorization Server Processing Rules

   *  Advertise authorization_details_types_metadata in metadata.

   *  Validate each authorization detail against schema.

   *  Enforce additional semantic checks.

   *  Reject missing or invalid details with standard OAuth error
      semantics.

6.3.  Resource Server Processing Rules

   *  Advertise authorization_details_types_metadata.

   *  Verify tokens against required authorization details.

   *  If insufficient, return HTTP 403 with WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
      error="insufficient_authorization_details".

   *  Do not reveal additional sensitive information.

8.2.  OAuth Metadata Attribute Registration

   The metadata attribute authorization_details_types_metadata is
   defined for OAuth authorization and resource server metadata, as a
   JSON object mapping authorization details types to documentation,
   schema, and examples.

Appendix A.  Examples

   This section provides non-normative examples of how this
   specification may be used to support specific use cases.

A.1.  Payment initiation with RAR error signaling

A.1.1.  Client initiates API request

   Client uses access token obtained at login to call payment initiation
   API

   POST /payments HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer eyj... (access token from login)

   {
       "type": "payment_initiation",
       "locations": [
           "https://server.example.com/payments"
       ],
       "instructedAmount": {
           "currency": "EUR",
           "amount": "123.50"
       },
       "creditorName": "Merchant A",
       "creditorAccount": {
           "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
           "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
       }
   }

A.1.2.  Resource server signals insufficient_authorization_details

   Resource server requires payment approval and responds with:

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_authorization_details",
    resource_metadata="https://server.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/payments",
    authorization_details=W3sKICAgICJ0eXBlIjogInBheW1lbnRfaW5pdGlhdGlvbiIsCiAgICAibG9jYXRpb25zIjogWwogICAgICAgICJodHRwczovL2V4YW1wbGUuY29tL3BheW1lbnRzIgogICAgXSwKICAgICJpbnN0cnVjdGVkQW1vdW50IjogewogICAgICAgICJjdXJyZW5jeSI6ICJFVVIiLAogICAgICAgICJhbW91bnQiOiAiMTIzLjUwIgogICAgfSwKICAgICJjcmVkaXRvck5hbWUiOiAiTWVyY2hhbnQgQSIsCiAgICAiY3JlZGl0b3JBY2NvdW50IjogewogICAgICAgICJiaWMiOiAiQUJDSURFRkZYWFgiLAogICAgICAgICJpYmFuIjogIkRFMDIxMDAxMDAxMDkzMDcxMTg2MDMiCiAgICB9LAogICAgImludGVyYWN0aW9uSWQiOiAiZjgxZDRmYWUtN2RlYy0xMWQwLWE3NjUtMDBhMGM5MWU2YmY2IiwKCSJyaXNrUHJvZmlsZSI6ICJCLTcxIgp9XQ==

   The base64 encoded authorization_details decodes to:

   [{
       "type": "payment_initiation",
       "locations": [
           "https://example.com/payments"
       ],
       "instructedAmount": {
           "currency": "EUR",
           "amount": "123.50"
       },
       "creditorName": "Merchant A",
       "creditorAccount": {
           "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
           "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
       },
       "interactionId": "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6",
       "riskProfile": "B-71"
   }]

   Note the resource server has added the ephemeral attributes:
   interactionId, riskProfile.

A.1.3.  Client initiates OAuth flow using the provided
        authorization_details object

   After user approves the request, client obtains single-use access
   token representing the approved payment

A.1.4.  Client re-attempts API request

   POST /payments HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer eyj... (payment approval access token)

   {
       "type": "payment_initiation",
       "locations": [
           "https://server.example.com/payments"
       ],
       "instructedAmount": {
           "currency": "EUR",
           "amount": "123.50"
       },
       "creditorName": "Merchant A",
       "creditorAccount": {
           "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
           "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
       }
   }

A.1.5.  Resource server authorizes the request

   HTTP/1.1 201 Accepted
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
       "paymentId": "a81bc81b-dead-4e5d-abff-90865d1e13b1",
       "status": "accepted"
   }
