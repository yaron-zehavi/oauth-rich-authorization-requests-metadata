Even though this document normally is cached on the web server, there is the issue of network traffic and the load of parsing the metadata.\n\nI suggest that instead of including the structures in the metadata document we reference a separate endpoint that serves the supported types. This way the metadata document will only indicate that the feature is supported (which is useful for discovery) by supplying the url of the endpoint. \n\nThe content served from the new endpoint would be similar to the current specification.",

And in the other case, where the RS does not know the data, then I don't see how this feature can be used. So there is something I don't understand here :-)",

Imagine client attempts a state changing RS call (PUT / POST etc + body).\nRS requires end-user's approval BUT the RAR object is not simply 1:1 the HTTP request body.\nMaybe it's structured differently, maybe it requires information available to RS but not to client, such as a calculated risk_score, or risk_ticket_id with which AS can retrieve additional instructions as to required challenges.\n\nSo this option is a step-up mechanism, with which client doesn't need to learn how to construct a RAR object but gets from RS a ready made one, which may include ephemeral data as described here.",

I can imagine that th RS could request the \"step-up\" and even indicate that it needs the information supplied in a given RAR type, but I am having trouble seeing how the RS could know how to build the complete RAR object. \n\nIn my ecosystem (The Norwegian health sector) we use several different RAR structures to supply extended information about the user context that the RS needs. Without that information all the RS can do is to reject the request and possibly specify the information that is missing.",
